## **What is R?**

A competent data scientist is a passionate coder-statistician, and there is no better programming language to master than R. R is known as the `golden child` of data science since it is the industry standard for statistical programming languages. It's a prominent ability among Big Data analysts, and R-skilled data scientists are in high demand from companies like Google, and Facebook. R is also very popular among researchers due to it's steep learning curve and high quality data visualization graphics for publication. 

> Top 9 points why to learn about R:
> 1. R is Open source and freely available
> 2. R is cross platform compatible
> 3. R is very powerful in handling big datasets
> 4. R is one of the top programming language having more than 2.5 million users
> 5. R is highly flexible and Evolving
> 6. Book or Manuscript publishers love R
> 7. Professors prefer students having R skills over the one who don't know R
> 8. R has a vibrant community and resources (Books, tutorials, blogs etc.)
> 9. Much more......
